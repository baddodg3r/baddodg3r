# 👋 Grüezi mitenand – I'm René

I'm a German developer living in Switzerland since 2009 – now deep into software, automation, and the occasional existential crisis caused by semicolons.  
Welcome to my GitHub – part portfolio, part playground, part therapy.

## 🧠 Who am I?

I started coding in **January 2022** and haven’t looked back since.  
Currently studying **Applikationsentwicklung at WISS Zürich**, while working at [Monos.one](https://monos.one) where I tame **IoT beasts**, script **Loxone** brains, and wire up smart energy systems using **MQTT** and **Modbus**.  
My toolbox: Python, Java, Bash, Docker – and a healthy respect for the unexpected.

## ⚡ What I Build

- 🍏 **Greenii App**  
  A multilingual marketplace for urban gardeners, built in Python with KivyMD.  
  _No Kotlin. Just willpower and Pythonic stubbornness._

- 💬 **Messenger App (WIP)**  
  A real-time messaging app using **MongoDB** for storage and **MQTT** for message delivery.  
  Built in Java. Event-driven. Lightweight. No SQL – because I like speed and challenge.

- 🧱 **Docker Everything**  
  From MongoDB to Minecraft – if it can run in a container, I will make it run in a container (or die trying ;)).

- 📊 **Power Query Kung-Fu**  
  Airtable API pagination with recursion in Excel? Yes. And yes, it works.

## 🔌 What I Tinker With at Monos.one

- 🔄 **MQTT** for real-time communication with automation systems  
- 🔧 **Modbus TCP** – protocol quirks and reliability hacks  
- 🏠 **Loxone Exosphere** – Workspace magic & scripting madness  
- ⚡ **Energy Optimization** – solar panels, heat pumps, load balancing
- 📈 **Excel Power Query** – recursive API access, data cleansing, and automation pipelines   
- 🧠 Designing systems that are smarter than they look – and dumber than they claim

## 🎓 What I Learn at WISS

- Functional Programming with Java (Streams, Lambdas, Pure Functions)  
- Unit Testing, Clean Code & Refactoring  
- SQL databases & JDBC integration  
- Spring Boot & API design  
- Cloud architectures (Docker, 12-Factor App, SaaS & migration strategies)  
- Real projects. Real deadlines. Real coffee.

## 💡 What I Know

**Languages & Tools**  
Java | Python | JavaScript | SQL | Bash | HTML/CSS  
Spring Boot | Kivy/KivyMD | MongoDB | MySQL | Docker & Compose  
Git | REST APIs | Power Query | MQTT | Modbus | Loxone  
openSUSE Tumbleweed (because real devs roll)

**Concepts That Stuck (Some Even On Purpose):**  
Functional Programming: `map()`, `filter()`, `reduce()`, pure functions  
Unit Testing, Refactoring, Clean Code  
JSON marshalling/unmarshalling  
12-Factor App design & cloud migration strategies

## 🧙‍♂️ Fun Facts

- 🇩🇪 German by birth, 🇨🇭 Swiss by choice  
- 👨‍👧‍👧 Father of two daughters – my best teachers and QA testers  
- 🏍️ Motorbike enthusiast, sailor, and tabletop gamer  
- 🐧 Proud user of openSUSE Tumbleweed – stability is for amateurs  
- ☕ Writes better code after midnight (or with espresso)

## 🤝 Let’s Connect

Like what you see? Want to collaborate, rage about Modbus quirks, or just ask why I don’t use emojis?  
**Open source is my playground – feel free to fork, star or PR. Just don’t break prod.**

_This README runs in openSUSE. All bugs are handcrafted. No emojis were harmed._
